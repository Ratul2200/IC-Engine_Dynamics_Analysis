# IC-Engine_Dynamics_Analysis
This repository includes the dynamical analysis of a 4 stroke IC Engine using Lagrangian and Newton-Eular approach with the help of [SymPy](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/index.html),[NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/index.html), and [SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/index.html).
This includes:
1. Model and analyse a single cylinder IC engine considering practical values of mass of piston and links, cylinder pressure variation.
2. Check the ground shaking forces.
3. Performance without balancing and with balancing and flywheel.
4. Plot, compare and discuss all results.
